## TBC Analystics Test (Beer Advocate)

**From [here](https://tcbanalytics.com/2016/01/29/how-to-hire-and-test-for-data-skills-a-one-size-fits-all-interview-kit/)**

"In an effort to make the interviewing experience a bit more fun, we use a dataset that involves beer. This dataset consists of 1.5 million beer reviews from Beer Advocate. It is an ideal dataset for testing candidates since it is too large to fit into Excel, but small enough to process on a single laptop in Python or R. We prefer that candidates complete the test in either Python or R, and generally if they are hesitant about using or trying to learn either of these languages, that should signal a red flag.

- Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?

- If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?

- Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?

- Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?"

Here's my attempt. 

if the data are taking too long to load, try the notebook at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/steviemooncat/beer-reviews)
